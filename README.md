## (S14) Group 18
__Group Members:__
* Dela Cruz, Diego
* Caramat, Jude
* Ishikawa, Andrew
* Santos, Emman

## Minecraft-styled Web Forum

- [ ] __Phase 1__:
* For this phase, the group is required to develop the front-end view of their
selected web application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
* Aside from base CSS and JavaScript, the group may also use interface libraries
like Bootstrap, meteor, and React, among others.
* All views by all users should be visible and navigable from the index webpage.
The group is required to implement the front-end view of all features described
in the project specifications document. The back-end logic of the minimum
features is not yet required to be implemented in this phase.
* Data may be hardcoded for now. There should be at least 5 sample data for each
applicable feature. Data encoded should be life-like, thus no lorem ipsum
generated paragraphs. For example, in a forum web application, there should be
at least 5 sample users, 5 sample posts, and 5 sample comments across the web
application.
* Students should collaborate through their groupâ€™s GitHub repository. The
repository will be used as reference in case problems arise with group
collaborations.
