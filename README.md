### Progress/Todo:
- [x] __Phase 1__
- [ ] __Phase 2__:
* For this phase, the group is required to develop the back-end logic of the chosen web application.
* The README.md file at the root directory of the repository should contain instructions
on how to set-up and to run the application locally through a Node.js server.
#### On Model
* Database design must be complete.
* It is recommended that the project use MongoDB for the database. Mongoose as
an ODM is accepted. If the group is looking to use a different database program,
please inform your lecturer ahead of time.
* Data should be retrieved from the database. There should be at least 5 sample
data in the database for each applicable feature. For example, in a forum web
application, there should be at least 5 sample users, 5 sample posts, and 5
sample comments loaded from the database to the web application.
* All database related files should be in the model folder.
#### On View
* All views for the features must be visible and can be navigated to and from the
index webpage.
* All views must be accessible from navigational links and buttons within the
application.
#### On Controller
* The web application should be hosted using a Node.js server.
* It should be accessible through localhost:3000.
* All routes should be properly and completely implemented. Thus, the user can
easily navigate through the different features of the web application.
* All forms must use the appropriate HTTP methods (i.e., login forms use POST,
search queries use GET, etc.). Form validation does not need to be implemented
yet.
* Session management and password hashing do not need to be implemented yet
for this phase.
